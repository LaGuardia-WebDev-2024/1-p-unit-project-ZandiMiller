   Why I Like These Artists
      </h2>
      <p>
     I don't just like artists for no reason. I need to connect with their music or want to learn something from their sounds. I love all these artists because, even though they're all pop, their sounds are very different, and they each try to convey their own unique messages that I can relate to.
